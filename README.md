Code to accompany the paper: Multiple feature fused correlation filters for infrared object tracking (submitted)
ITM tracker is a correlation filter-based infrared object tracking method that fuses intensity, texture, and motion features and dynamically updates the weights of these features.

Results
We show the tracking results of all the videos in our paper, and the original videos are also presented for comparison. 
Our ITM tracker is evaluated on six video sequences, that is, rng14_15, rng17_20, rng18_03, rng22_08, person1, and person2. The first four videos are from a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) image sequence dataset, longwave infrared AMCOM closure sequences, and the last two videos are from an infrared video surveillance dataset, OSU Color-Thermal Database.
